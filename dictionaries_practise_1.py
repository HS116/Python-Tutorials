#sorting a dictionary by ascending values

scores = {"Alice": 45, "Bob" : 42, "Charles" : 36}

set = {1,2,2}
#sets automatically discard duplicates btw
print(set)
#and sets are unordered, so we cannot index them like below
#set[0] = 3

#also sets are implemented as hash tables, hence O(1) constant time complexity for accessing set
